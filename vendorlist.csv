\section{Discussion}
Testing will be done regularly from the first-day our components arrive to assure quality and functionality. As we assemble each component together, testing will help in debugging and localizing the issue in the system. Creating tests for each component helps with creating a good understanding on how that device individually works as well as how it interacts with other devices and software. On the topic of software, testing is of critical importance, without testing the software integration could lead to unforeseen behavior within the system as a whole. If our tests were done correctly, on demo day it will present our flawless creation, the freedom rover units to the world.
\section{Demo Description}
Our goal is to demonstrate one of these three demos on demo day. The First demo shows each drone/rover coordinating with one another to align themself to make a letter. An example of this demo: from the server we give the task of creating the letter ‘L’, with 5 drones scattered on the map, each rover will represent a pixel and will move to that spot. If there were two rovers that are the same distance away from a spot, one rover will have higher priority over the other and the rover with the higher priority will get that spot. As for the other rover it will go to the next closest open spot. Another option for the First demo, is that each rover will have multiple different LED lights to make a light show on the ground.

The Second demo is to have the rovers coordinate with one another to move an object from one location to another. An example: 3 rovers scattered around the map. The map is 5’ by 5’, where (0,0) is located at the bottom left corner and (5,5) is located at the top right corner. Each rover get the task to move a cardboard box from (1,1) to (4,3). All 3 rovers will communicate and align themselves around the box, to move it to the said location. Once done, they will wait for their next instruction which may be to move it to a different location.

As for our last demo, the Third demo shows drones moving in a line around the map. For example: there are 2 tasks, the first task is to follow behind another drone and the second task is to move around the map. The second task will be given to one rover only and the first task will be given to all the other drones on the map. In this demo, there are 5 drones scattered throughout map and drone named \#2 will get the second task. As for the other Drones: \#1,\#3,\#4,\#5, they will get the first task. Let’s say the order of drone conga line is : \#2,\#3,\#1,\#5,\#4. If we were to separate \#1 from the conga line and place it elsewhere on th
